Using the console

# create 10 new blogs
# create several posts for each blog
# create several messages for the first blog
# know how to retrieve all the messages for the first blog

Message.joins(:post => :blog).where(:posts => {:blog_id => 1}).all

# know how to retrieve all posts for the first blog

Blog.first.posts.all

# know how to retrieve all posts for the last blog (sorted by title in the DESC order)

Blog.last.posts.order("title DESC")

# know how to update the first post's title

k = Post.first
k.title = "Rock of Ages"
k.save

# know how to delete the third post (have the model 
automatically delete all messages associated with the third post when you delete the third post)

Post.find(3).destroy
:has_many :posts, :dependent => :destroy

know how to retrieve all blogs

Blog.all

know how to retrieve all blogs whose id is less than 10
